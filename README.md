## Final Project Milestone 1 Reflection

In my Final Project Plan Proposal, I stated this benchmark for Milestone 1: “I have loaded all data files into pandas DataFrames, began experimenting with different visualizations, and am making any necessary adjustments to the DataFrames (e.g., I need to create a new column in order to accurately portray a certain graph) so they will be ready to be used for the final visualizations.”

Overall, I believe I have met my goals for this milestone. I loaded in and explored each of my five data files to determine which are and are not relevant for answering my driving question and therefore which files I should continue pursuing with this project. Throughout this milestone I only used barplot visualizations because those were the most helpful for me while exploring my data, but I have not yet determined if those would be the best visualizations for my final deliverable, and so that is something I will explore further in my next milestone. In terms of any necessary adjustments to the DataFrames, I did apply filters to limit how many observations were included in each visualization, so I can choose to either keep using those filters in the future or store that filtered data in a new DataFrame and move forward with the new DataFrames. I can make that decision in the next milestone. All in all I am very happy with the progress I have made so far and I believe I have a much better understanding of my data and the direction I am going to take this project. 

One limitation with the data I have acquired is that these are metrics, and that means these numbers can tell us what users have been doing on our website, but it cannot tell us the why of their behavior. We really only have part of the story here, which is absolutely better than nothing because it still gives us something to work with and learn from, but I do recognize that a more complete picture (what + why) would provide us a better understanding of the value our website's content brings to our users.

When thinking about data quality, I am very aware that my data is from external sources that I am not familiar with. In regard to the one non-Google Analytics data file that was sent to me by the Executive Director of Digital Communications (the menu link usage file), in her email to me she said that data was from a “lookerstudio report.” I did not know what this meant, so I looked it up and Looker Studio seems to be a data visualization platform owned by Google. This is also a platform I am not familiar with, and so I am not sure where the data within this report came from, but maybe it came from Google Analytics itself since they are owned by the same company; maybe you can link the Looker Studio and Google Analytics accounts. So really I am not sure where the data in this file came from, but ultimately I decided not to use this data anyway because another data file of mine would better answer my driving question. While I am glad I thought through the sourcing of this data, its uncertain quality is not going to be a concern for the future of this project.

Because Kent State University's Google Analytics account is set up for the entirety of kent.edu, there is an existing report template that has already been structured and set up for filtering only data from individual departments' websites. The instructions provided to me said to make a copy of this report template and input into the filter my department's URL (/lgbtq) so only data from our website would be included in the report. I followed the rest of the steps and downloaded the four resulting data files so I could import them into python. Obviously with this process, I am putting my trust into the Kent State employee who set up the report template in the first place. I can see that this template was last modified September 26, 2024, so at least it has been reviewed recently and hopefully if there were any previously identified issues they were able to be fixed, but I would not know that information. I also have to trust that this report template is going to give me the data I need to answer my driving question for this project, as I am not familiar enough with Google Analytics to make changes to my report settings and try acquiring different metrics, nor do I have the time.

I also have to trust that Google Analytics itself has collected the metrics and given them to me as it is supposed to, and again without already being familiar with that process I don't know how I would check that. The LGBTQ+ Center has never done its own web analytics report and I am not aware of any other department doing a web analytics report for us specifically. I did not even know KSU was tracking analytics (though in hindsight it makes sense) and it never came up in my work with my center's website, so I am kind of chagrined that we haven't been looking at this sooner. I suppose it wasn't ever really a priority for our department; we do only have 2 full time staff members and no one within our department until me has really worked consistently on our own website. Unfortunately Google Analytics data only lasts 18 months (according to the instruction document given to me), so I can't even go back and download our data from previous years to compare each of those years with what I will be analyzing now. 

All that is to say, the data I have seems to be all there is to work with. The only other source of data I could think of that could be used to answer my driving question would be actually surveying real users of our website and just asking them what they use our website for and what content is valuable to them (this would be useful because we could also get insight into the "why" that content is valuable), but obviously that is beyond the scope of this class and there is not nearly enough time for that.

In regards to relating this project to my future career, Google Analytics is supposedly used by “millions of website and app owners” (according to their own website), and so it is possible that my future employer may expect me to use Google Analytics data to create reports to determine if our website goals have been achieved and any new goals we can begin to strive towards. Therefore, through this project I am becoming familiar with Google Analytics itself and the many kinds of metrics it tracks and how that data can be used to identify areas of success and improvements for a website. 

In regards to my primary audience, since I am not into the fine-tuning of the data visualization aspect of this project yet, I was not really thinking about my primary audience during my data exploration. However, reflecting on it now, my target audience (my supervisor and other higher education administrators) are busy people with many different things asking for their time and attention. Therefore, I think it makes sense for me to be very selective with my data, ensuring only the most relevant are included so that I can make my main arguments and recommendations without distracting from my main message with irrelevant information/graphics for data that does not help me achieve my goal. Basically, I don’t want to waste my audience’s time, and so I think only using two data files is okay because they contain the most relevant data for answering my driving question and addressing the specific topic of my project.
